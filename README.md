# GraphLearn
Learn how to construct graphs given representative examples.

Discriminative systems that can deal with graphs in input are known, however, generative or constructive approaches that can sample graphs from empirical distributions are less developed. This is a Metropolisâ€“Hastings approach that uses a novel type of graph grammar to efficiently learn proposal distributions in a data driven fashion.
